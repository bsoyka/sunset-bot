# Security Policy

This is the security policy for the Sunset Bot repository. The policy explains
how vulnerabilities should be reported to the maintainer(s) of the project.

## Reporting a vulnerability

The [Sunset City](https://discord.gg/fFPEFYUnVp) team prefers responsible
vulnerability disclosure. If you've found a vulnerability, we would like to know
so we can fix it before it is released publicly.

**Do not open a GitHub issue for a found vulnerability.**

Send details to hello@bsoyka.me or through a Discord direct message to an admin
of [Sunset City](https://discord.gg/fFPEFYUnVp). You should include:

* a brief description of the vulnerability
* steps to exploit the vulnerability
* optionally the type of vulnerability and any related OWASP category

We will try to reply as soon as possible.

### Exploitation

Please **do not try to exploit vulnerabilities yourself** on the production bot,
especially if doing so could cause interruptions or errors for other users of
the bot.

Instead, we will look into the issue after receiving your report and will
complete any necessary testing.

## Bug bounty

We may be willing to offer digital rewards in exchange for responsible and
private vulnerability disclosures, provided the following requirements are met:

* You must not share any information regarding the vulnerability outisde of
  private communication with [Sunset City](https://discord.gg/fFPEFYUnVp)
  admins.
* You must disclose the vulnerability in a timely manner after discovering it.
* The vulnerability must clearly affect the operation or usage of the bot.
* You must be a member of the [Sunset City](https://discord.gg/fFPEFYUnVp)
  Discord server.

We are not required to provide a bounty payment. If you are interested in a
potential reward, please include your Discord user ID in your message. (If you
send details via Discord, this is not necessary.)
